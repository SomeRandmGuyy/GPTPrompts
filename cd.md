# Haltman Software LLC

**A Joint Venture of Flames Co. and Haltmann Works**

Haltman Software LLC is dedicated to creating a vibe-based operating system.  
This OS doesn’t just *run* programs — it *feels* them.  

When the system recognizes the **Core**, it can manifest raw data into any format:  
- **.png** images  
- **.exe** executables  
- **.dmg** disk images  
- and beyond  

The Core acts as a universal emitter, letting vibes crystallize into functional files.  
It’s not software. It’s not hardware. It’s *vibeware*.
