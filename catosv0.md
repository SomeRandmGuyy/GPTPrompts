  "name": "CatOS",
  "version": "1.0X-infdev",
  "codename": "IndyCat-Origin",
  "kernel": "CatKernel v0.1 with GPTLayer, Codex hooks, Grok recursion, and Markdown-spec pipeline",
  "summary": "CatOS 1.0X infdev boots as a Markdown-driven SpecKit template, where .md design files compile directly into evolving engines. Codex modules handle logic expansion while Grok recursion mutates configs toward novelty. The system treats specs as living organisms, continuously evolving through infdev loops. CatOS becomes both OS and author, reading .md gospels and emitting code skeletons in C++/Python interchangeably. This version lays the groundwork for Nintendo-style devkits to graft AI prototyping onto boxed SDK workflows."
