  "name": "Samsoft Unix Emulator",
  "version": "1.X-infdev",
  "codename": "IndyCat-Origin",
  "kernel": "CatKernel v0.1 with GPTLayer, Codex hooks, Grok recursion, Markdown-spec pipeline, and LightFS photon layer",
  "summary": "Samsoft Unix Emulator 1.X infdev runs as a Markdown-driven SpecKit, where .md blueprints compile directly into Unix-like environments. Codex modules extend shell logic while Grok recursion mutates configs to explore novel system states. The emulator treats specs as living processes, evolving across infdev loops. It can emit C++/Python stubs for Unix commands and daemons interchangeably. With LightFS photon channels, all compiled binaries refract into cross-platform ELF, .exe, or .dmg, simulating a universal Unix lattice at light speed."
