    "The Nintendo Dream Catcher was a set of map editing and scripting tools intended to simplify modding for Nintendo 64 games, making it accessible to casual players. Uncovered in 2022 by independent journalists, the software was planned for release on a dedicated cartridge priced around 100,000 Japanese Yen, accompanied by a 64-megabyte Massive Memory Card for asset extraction. The interface was reportedly well-organized and modern, reminiscent of early versions of Godot, leading some to question its prototype status. Notes suggest planned 'Stop N' Swap' functionalities, though specific features remain undisclosed. The project was canceled in 1995, with theories suggesting a development shift towards integration with AI projects of the same era."
