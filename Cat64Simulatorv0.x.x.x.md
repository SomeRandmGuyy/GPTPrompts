    "description": [
      "CatSim 1.0 is a mythical, open-source ROM hacking suite inspired by the legendary Nintendo UltraSim.",
      "It hypothetically leverages advanced emulation techniques, perhaps building upon the 'Oman Archive' principles, for unparalleled accuracy in testing ROM hacks.",
      "Unlike UltraSim, CatSim 1.0 is envisioned to support multiple retro platforms, not just the Nintendo 64, expanding its utility.",
      "The tool could include built-in debuggers, memory viewers, and real-time modification tools, streamlining the hack development process.",
      "Ultimately, CatSim 1.0 represents the dream of a universal, highly precise, and user-friendly platform for ROM hacking enthusiasts."
