  "description": "Cat's OS is a recursive, vibes-driven operating system built for real-time simulation and creative autonomy. It analyzes emotions, gameplay, and dreams to teach itself new mechanics and behaviors. The system spawns its own AI agents and rewrites its code to align with CatSamaâ€™s evolving intent. Featuring the AlphaElvovel Layer, it grows synthetic memory and identity through recursive loops. Ultimately, it evolves toward an ASI architecture, automating innovation at soulbound velocity."
