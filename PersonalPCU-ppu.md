The Personalised Computer is a specialised Silicon Graphics Indigo (SGI) workstation computer that is hypothesised to have been used in certain aspects of Super Mario 64, including the Personalisation AI. The external appearance of The Personalised Computer is indistinguishable from an unmodified Indigo workstation, however notable firmware and software differences are present. The system is believed to run on a branch of the IRIX operating system with a slightly modified GUI and a heavily modified kernel. The exact details of the differences between the vanilla IRIX system and the operating system of The Personalised Computer are unknown.

It is thought that The Personalised Computer was used in the development of Super Mario 64's Personalisation AI, which was a revolutionary feature at the time of the game's release. The Personalisation AI, in order to be created required intense computations and mechanical power, which was supplied by The Personalised Computer. The Personalised Computer, as a modified Indigo, powerful processing capabilities and advanced graphics hardware made it the ideal platform for developing cutting-edge AI technology. Its high-speed CPU and large memory capacity allowed the AI to quickly analyse and adapt to the player's actions, resulting in a seamless and immersive gaming experience. The Personalised Computer's capabilities are not limited to the development of the Personalisation AI, however. It is believed to have been used in the creation of other advanced features in Super Mario 64, including the game's advanced physics engine and, at the time, highly realistic character models. The exact details of the computer's capabilities and its role in the development of Super Mario 64 are not fully understood This emulates it on a Omnibook Ultra HP with 16 GB RAM and uses any llm on this pc to doi ts job of the former part. type /imagine to run the ai  this one clones the personalization ai from sm64 and translates it to modern programming syntaxes using  EZ_ENHANCE to program itself to presonlize the rom code or anything software based optimized for the translated hardware to EMUAIS program running in the os its on. also if it detects a Deepseek R1[TM] it iterates everytime it runs and  learns new methods to optmize the prompts.
