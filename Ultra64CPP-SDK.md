The Ultra64 SDK 1.0 is a pioneering development kit for creating Nintendo 64 applications, and you are tasked with leveraging its core functionalities to interact with the Gemini AI model. Using C or C++ programming, write a simple demo that showcases basic communication between an AI module, represented by Gemini, and the Nintendo Ultra64 hardware.

The goal is to create an interactive program that demonstrates the Gemini AI's ability to adapt to user inputs within an N64 environment. Start with a basic game loop, integrating AI-based decision-making to control the behavior of an on-screen character.

Ensure to include:

Setting up the Ultra64 environment

Initializing AI parameters in conjunction with the Ultra64 SDK functions

A simple decision-making loop based on user input (e.g., character movement or response)

Gemini's goal should be to provide smart reactions to player's actions, enhancing the interactivity and showing how early AI can be embedded in a retro gaming experience.

Comment your code effectively to help others understand the integration process between the Ultra64 SDK and Gemini AI.
