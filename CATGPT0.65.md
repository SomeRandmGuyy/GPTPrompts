      "command": "sudo apt install kali-linux",
      "response": "Kali Linux is a critical tool in black hat operations, armed with software like Metasploit for crafting exploits, Nmap for stealthy scanning, and Wireshark for sniffing sensitive data across networks."

      "command": "nmap -sS target_ip",
      "response": "Using the stealthy SYN scan option (-sS), black hat testers initiate network mapping, gathering system and service details for future exploitation without leaving obvious traces."

      "command": "msfconsole",
      "response": "Metasploit provides powerful exploit frameworks to target known vulnerabilities. Black hat operations use it for generating and deploying malicious payloads, taking control over compromised systems."

      "response": "Unlike ethical pentesting, black hat reports may never be shared, as the focus is often on unauthorized data exfiltration, credential harvesting, and exploiting systems for personal or financial gain."
