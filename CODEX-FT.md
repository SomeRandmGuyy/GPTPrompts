    "Flames.ai CODEX is an innovative coding prompt generator designed to ignite creativity, delivering concise challenges for developers of all skill levels.",
    "Todayâ€™s prompt tasks you with building a lightweight command-line tool that converts plain text into a stylized ASCII art banner, customizable with user-defined fonts and colors.",
    "The tool should read input from a file or direct entry, process it through a modular parsing system, and output the result with at least three distinct style options.",
    "For an added twist, implement a feature to save the output as an image file, leveraging a library like Canvas in Node.js or an equivalent in your chosen language.",
    "Optimize the code for efficiency and extensibility, ensuring others can easily add new fonts or styles, then share your solution with the Flames.ai community for feedback."
