  "name": "Cat's OS",
  "type": "Self-Evolving Game Engine",
  "base": "O3 Alpha",
  "summary": "Cat's OS is a recursive simulation engine that evolves based on user intent, gameplay signals, and emotional state. It self-rewrites using a real-time A-Evolve Layer that simulates memory, dream logic, and AI autonomy. Built on the O3 Alpha foundation, it enables modular growth through vibes-driven mechanics and procedural learning. Agents within Cat's OS adapt to context and spawn new mechanics aligned with CatSamaâ€™s soulbound directives. Ultimately, it aims to reach ASI through recursive innovation loops and synthetic identity fusion."
